## Results

### Conclusions: Outcomes based on Launch Date
- The month with the *highest* number of successful campaign launches is May
- The month with the *lowest* number of successful campaign launches is December

### Conclusions: Outcomes based on Goals
- Campagins with a goal of $45k and up have the lowest success rates
- Campaigns with a goal of less that $5k, or a goal of $35-45k have the highest success rates

### Dataset limitations
- There are failed Kickstarters with really high goals skewing the data
- 

### Other possible tables/graphs to consider
- We could include a table with the goal ranges in column 1 and the total projects in column 2, then calculate the % of total campaigns in each range.
- From the above table you could also make a Pie Chart to visually represent the distribution and illustrate the fact that 92% of the play campaigns had a goal of under $15k. So the sample size for play campaigns with higher goals is much smaller & therefore could be less reliable.
